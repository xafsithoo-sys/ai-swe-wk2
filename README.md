🌍 Kenya Water AI — Predicting Weather & Rainfall for a Sustainable Future
💧 Overview

Kenya Water AI is an AI-powered web application designed to predict rainfall and weather conditions across Kenyan counties.
Using machine learning (TensorFlow) and Streamlit, this tool provides accurate climate forecasts, visual analytics, and interactive exploration of weather patterns.

This project contributes directly to:

🌊 SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation: by supporting better planning and management of water resources through predictive analytics.

🌦️ SDG 13 – Climate Action: by using AI to monitor and predict changing climate patterns, helping communities prepare for weather extremes.

🚀 Features

✅ Rainfall & Weather Prediction – AI model predicts rainfall levels and temperature patterns.
✅ Interactive Visualization – Explore weather trends by county, year, and month.
✅ Dynamic Charts – Compare temperature, humidity, and rainfall visually.
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Built with Streamlit for smooth and interactive experience.
✅ Supports UN SDGs – Enables data-driven decision-making for climate resilience.
